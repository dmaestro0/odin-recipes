<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>   
<p>Ropa Vieja is one of my favorite Cuban dishes, served over white rice and accompanied with black beans. It’s considered a comfort food and is often served on special occasions or at family gatherings. The name “ropa vieja” literally translates to “old clothes” in Spanish, and the dish is named this way because the shredded beef used in the recipe resembles torn or tattered clothing. Leftovers can be made into tacos, bowls, served over loaded fries, and more! More Latin beef recipes you will love are Picadillo, Carnitas and Mexican Beef.</p>

<h3>How to Make Cuban Ropa Vieja</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Season the beef with salt, Sazón, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper.</li>
    <li> Tomato Sauce: Whisk the tomato paste, wine, and broth in a medium bowl. If you’re cooking this dish on the stove, use 3 cups of broth – you’ll need more since some of it will evaporate on the stove.</li>
    <li> Sauté: Heat the Instant Pot by setting it on the sauté button. Add the oil and then the onions, bell peppers, and garlic and cook for three to four minutes until softened. Then press cancel. On the stove, do the same thing but in a large Dutch oven on medium-high heat.</li>
    <li> Nestle the meat into the onions so half are on the bottom and half above the meat. Add the carrots, olives, bay leaves, and cilantro (if using). Pour the tomato sauce over the mixture.</li>
    <li> <strong>Instant Pot Ropa Vieja: Put the lid on the pressure cooker and cook on high for 45 minutes. Once done, unplug the pot and do a natural release.</strong></li>
    <li> Stove: Bring the pot to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat easily shreds. It should take about one and a half to two hours. Add more water if it gets too dry.</li>
    <li> Shred the beef, discard the bay leaves, and top with more cilantro if desired.</li>
