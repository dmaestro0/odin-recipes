<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>   
<p>Pastelón de plátano maduro (ripe plantain casserole) combines the delicate sweetness of ripe plantains, flavorful, juicy beef filling, & melting cheese. It is one of my favorite dishes. It's just pure bliss.</p>
<p>Great for your get-togethers, potlucks, and cookouts, this dish is also part of our traditional Christmas feast. This is possibly the second most popular plantain recipe in the Dominican Republic. A dish that nearly no one will turn down. </p>
